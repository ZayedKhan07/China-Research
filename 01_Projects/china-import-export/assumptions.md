# Assumptions — First China Market Visit

These are working assumptions, not guarantees. Some will be wrong.
The point is to write them down so I can check them against reality
and adjust.

---

## Travel and visa

- **I can get a China tourist or business visa.** Visa approval is
  not guaranteed. Processing takes 1–2 weeks minimum, possibly
  longer. I may need to show a hotel booking, return flight, and
  proof of funds.

- **Direct flights may not be the cheapest option.** Layovers in
  Hong Kong, Seoul, or other hubs might save money but add travel
  time and complexity.

- **China's entry requirements may change.** COVID-era rules are
  mostly gone, but health declarations, visa policies, or transit
  rules could shift with little notice.

- **I'll need a working VPN.** Google, WhatsApp, and most Western
  apps are blocked. I need to set this up before arriving — it's
  harder to install once inside China.

---

## Budget and time

- **The trip will cost more than I estimate.** Unexpected expenses
  always appear: extra travel days, sample purchases, tips,
  translation help, SIM issues, transport between cities.

- **7–10 days is a realistic minimum.** Less than a week won't
  allow meaningful market visits across multiple cities. More than
  two weeks may hit diminishing returns for a first trip.

- **I won't have time to visit everything.** Yiwu, Guangzhou, and
  Shenzhen are all worth seeing, but covering all three properly
  in one trip may not be realistic. Better to do one or two well.

- **Daily budget should assume $100–200 USD/day all-in.** Covers
  accommodation, food, transport, and incidentals. Can be lower
  with budget choices, but buffer is wise.

---

## Language and communication

- **English is not widely spoken in wholesale markets.** Some
  suppliers have English-speaking staff, but many don't. Basic
  transactions work, complex negotiations don't.

- **Translation apps help but aren't enough.** Good for menus and
  signs, unreliable for business discussions. Misunderstandings
  are likely.

- **A translator or sourcing agent may be necessary.** Even just
  for a day or two at key markets. Cost: roughly $50–150/day for
  a freelance translator.

- **WeChat is essential.** It's the primary communication tool for
  Chinese suppliers. I need to set up an account before the trip
  and be comfortable using it.

## Supplier behavior and trust

- **Suppliers will quote high initially.** First-quoted prices are
  not final. Negotiation is expected and normal.

- **Not all suppliers are honest.** Some will exaggerate quality,
  hide defects, or quote unrealistic lead times. Verification
  matters — samples, factory visits, references.

- **MOQs are negotiable, but not infinitely.** Minimum order
  quantities exist for a reason. Some suppliers will do smaller
  orders for new buyers; others won't bother.

- **Relationships take time.** A single visit won't build deep
  trust. First orders are often treated as tests by both sides.

- **Trading companies and factories are different.** A "factory"
  listed on Alibaba may actually be a middleman. On-the-ground
  visits help clarify who I'm really dealing with.

---

## Pricing and negotiation

- **Prices vary wildly for the same product.** Different suppliers,
  different quality tiers, different MOQs. Comparing quotes requires
  apples-to-apples specs.

- **Quoted price is rarely the final landed cost.** FOB price
  excludes shipping, insurance, customs, duties, VAT, and last-mile.
  These can add 30–50%+ to the unit cost.

- **Volume unlocks better pricing, but I don't have volume yet.**
  First orders will have worse unit economics. That's expected.

- **Negotiation is normal and expected.** Walking away, asking for
  discounts, and comparing suppliers openly is standard practice.
  Being too agreeable leaves money on the table.

---

## Payments and currency

- **Suppliers prefer specific payment methods.** Common options:
  bank transfer (T/T), Western Union, Alibaba Trade Assurance,
  sometimes PayPal. Credit cards are rare.

- **Payment terms for new buyers are unfavorable.** Expect to pay
  30% deposit upfront, 70% before shipping. Better terms come
  with repeat orders and trust.

- **Currency exchange costs add up.** USD to CNY conversions,
  wire transfer fees, and exchange rate fluctuations are real
  costs. Budget 2–5% for payment friction.

- **Sending money internationally isn't instant.** Bank transfers
  can take 3–5 business days. Delays can push back production
  timelines.

---

## Logistics and customs

- **Shipping costs are hard to estimate in advance.** Depends on
  product weight, volume, shipping method (air/sea/courier), and
  current freight rates. I won't have real numbers until I have
  a real product and real quotes.

- **Customs and duties vary by product category.** I need to look
  up the HS code for anything I'm considering and check the duty
  rate for my destination country.

- **Customs clearance isn't automatic.** Paperwork errors, missing
  documents, or random inspections can cause delays. First
  shipments often have more friction.

- **Small shipments are expensive per unit.** Courier (DHL, FedEx)
  is fast but costly. Sea freight is cheap but slow and only makes
  sense at volume. Air freight is in between.

- **I don't fully understand incoterms yet.** FOB, CIF, DDP, EXW —
  these define who pays for what and where responsibility
  transfers. I need to learn this before negotiating shipping.

---

## Personal capacity and risk tolerance

- **I'm doing this solo.** No team, no partner, no assistant. That
  limits how much ground I can cover and how many things I can
  manage at once.

- **I have limited capital.** I can't absorb a large failed order.
  First orders need to be small enough to lose without serious
  damage.

- **I have no prior import-export experience.** I will make
  mistakes — in negotiation, logistics, customs paperwork, or
  supplier selection. The goal is to keep mistakes cheap.

- **I may not be suited for this.** It's possible I'll conclude
  that importing from China isn't right for me — too complex, too
  capital-intensive, too dependent on relationships I can't build.
  That's a valid outcome.

- **This trip is an experiment, not a commitment.** I'm testing a
  hypothesis, not launching a business. If the numbers don't work,
  I stop.

## Assumptions to validate on this trip

These are the ones I'll actively try to confirm or reject:

- [ ] Can I communicate well enough without fluent Mandarin?
- [ ] Are the prices I find in-person better than Alibaba?
- [ ] Is the product quality verifiable before ordering?
- [ ] Can I get useful samples shipped affordably?
- [ ] Do the landed cost numbers make business sense?
- [ ] Is this something I want to do again?
