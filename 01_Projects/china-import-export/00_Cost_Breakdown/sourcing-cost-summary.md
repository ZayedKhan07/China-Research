## Summary

**Estimated sourcing cost range:**
- **USD:** $170 – $1,650
- **AED:** AED 620 – AED 6,060
- **INR:** ₹14,000 – ₹1,37,000

**Realistic mid-range budget for first-trip sourcing: ~$575 / ₹48,000**

This covers the cost of evaluating suppliers and products while on
the ground in China — separate from travel and shipping costs.

Key variable: translator/agent. Going without saves money but limits
depth of conversations and negotiation. In Yiwu, some agents have
experience with Indian buyers and may speak basic Hindi.
