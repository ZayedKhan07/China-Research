# Cost Breakdown

This folder tracks the financial side of the China trip and produces
a single, honest number: the total door-to-door cost.

## Currency Assumptions

All costs are presented in three currencies. USD is the base currency;
AED and INR are converted using the rates below.

| Currency | Rate (per 1 USD) | Note                          |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| USD      | 1.00             | Base currency                 |
| AED      | 3.67             | Approximate, may fluctuate    |
| INR      | 83.00            | Approximate, may fluctuate    |

**These are planning assumptions, not live rates.** Update with actual
rates when making payments or finalizing budgets.

## What this folder is for

To answer the question: **"What does it actually cost to get a
product from a Chinese market to my door in India?"**

Not estimates. Not averages from the internet. Real numbers from
this specific trip, broken into categories I can audit and update.

## How the files roll up

```
travel-cost-summary.md      →  Cost of getting me to China and back
sourcing-cost-summary.md    →  Cost of finding and evaluating suppliers
logistics-cost-summary.md   →  Cost of moving goods from China to India
                               ─────────────────────────────────────────
total-door-to-door-cost.md  →  Sum of the above, per unit and total
```

Each file feeds into the final total. If a number changes upstream,
the total should be updated to reflect it.

## What "door-to-door" means financially

Door-to-door cost includes everything between leaving home in India
and receiving goods at home:

- **Travel:** Visa, flights, hotels, food, transport, translator,
  SIM card, miscellaneous expenses
- **Sourcing:** Samples, market entry fees, supplier gifts, any
  costs incurred while evaluating products and suppliers
- **Logistics:** Freight (air/sea/courier), insurance, export docs,
  customs clearance, duties, GST, last-mile delivery to India

The total is expressed as:
1. **Absolute cost** — total money spent
2. **Per-unit cost** — total divided by units ordered (once known)

The per-unit cost is what matters for business decisions. It shows
whether the landed price leaves room for margin.

## When to update these files

- **Before the trip:** Fill in estimates for travel costs (visa,
  flights, hotels, daily budget). Leave sourcing and logistics
  blank or with rough placeholders.

- **During the trip:** Update travel actuals as I spend. Add
  sourcing costs (samples, translator fees, etc.) as they happen.

- **After the trip:** Finalize travel and sourcing. Fill in
  logistics once I have real freight quotes and a product to ship.

- **After first shipment arrives:** Update logistics with actual
  customs, duties, and delivery costs. Calculate final per-unit
  landed cost.

The total file should always reflect the current state — estimates
where actuals aren't known yet, actuals where they are.
