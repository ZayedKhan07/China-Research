## What This Total Represents

This is the **all-in cost** of:

1. Traveling from India to China, staying 8–10 days, and returning
2. Visiting markets, evaluating suppliers, collecting samples
3. Shipping samples and/or a small first order back to India
4. Paying all duties, taxes (IGST), and delivery fees

This does **not** include:
- The cost of goods themselves (product purchase price)
- Inventory storage or warehousing after arrival
- Selling, marketing, or business setup costs
- IEC registration or GST registration (one-time, separate)
- Time/opportunity cost

## Total Cost Including First Order (USD)

|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Trip + logistics       | $1,276    | $3,150    | $6,733    | —      |

## Total Investment (Multi-Currency)

| Estimate | USD       | AED         | INR          |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Low      | $1,776    | AED 6,518   | ₹1,47,408    |

| High     | $8,733    | AED 32,050  | ₹7,24,839    |

## Per-Unit Cost Calculation

The per-unit landed cost is the number that matters for business
viability. It depends on order quantity.

### Example: Mid-Range Scenario (USD)

| Input                        | USD       | INR         |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Trip + logistics cost        | $3,150    | ₹2,61,450   |
| Product purchase (goods)     | $1,000    | ₹83,000     |
| **Total investment**         | **$4,150**| **₹3,44,450**|

| Units ordered | Total (USD) | Per unit (USD) | Per unit (INR) |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 50 units      | $4,150      | $83.00         | ₹6,889         |
| 100 units     | $4,150      | $41.50         | ₹3,445         |
| 200 units     | $4,150      | $20.75         | ₹1,722         |
| 500 units     | $4,150      | $8.30          | ₹689           |

**Key insight:** Fixed costs (travel, sourcing) dominate at low
volumes. Per-unit cost drops dramatically as order size increases.

---

## Amortizing Travel Costs

Travel and sourcing are one-time costs for establishing supplier
relationships. They can be amortized over multiple orders.

### Single-Trip Amortization (Mid Estimates)

| Scenario                     | Travel+Sourcing | Orders | Per-order (USD) | Per-order (INR) |
|------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| One order, one trip          | $2,315          | 1      | $2,315          | ₹1,92,145       |
| Two orders from same trip    | $2,315          | 2      | $1,158          | ₹96,114         |
| Three orders (reorders)      | $2,315          | 3      | $772            | ₹64,076         |

If you place reorders with suppliers found on this trip, the travel
cost per order decreases. The trip becomes an investment rather than
a one-time expense.

## Break-Even Thinking

To evaluate if importing makes sense, compare landed cost to
alternatives:

| Question                                         | How to answer                |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| What does this product cost from local supplier? | Research Indian wholesalers  |
| What's the retail price I can sell at?           | Market research in India     |
| What margin do I need?                           | Business model dependent     |
| Does the landed cost leave room for margin?      | Math below                   |

### Example Margin Calculation

| Item                          | USD     | INR       |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Product FOB price (China)     | $5.00   | ₹415      |
| Landed cost per unit (at 100) | $41.50  | ₹3,445    |
| Local wholesale alternative   | $30.00  | ₹2,490    |
| Target retail price           | $70.00  | ₹5,810    |

**In this example:** Importing is worse than local wholesale because
the landed cost (₹3,445) exceeds local price (₹2,490). This only
makes sense if:
- Order quantity is much higher (500+ units)
- The product isn't available locally in India
- Future reorders reduce amortized travel cost
- Quality/uniqueness justifies higher cost

## Summary

**Estimated total door-to-door investment:**

| Estimate | USD           | AED            | INR             |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Low      | $1,800        | AED 6,500      | ₹1,50,000       |
| Mid      | $4,150        | AED 15,200     | ₹3,45,000       |
| High     | $8,700        | AED 32,000     | ₹7,25,000       |

**Realistic mid-range estimate: ~$4,150 / ₹3,45,000**
(including ~$1,000 / ₹83,000 in goods)

This covers everything from visa application in India to goods
arriving at your door. The per-unit economics only work at
sufficient volume or with reorders that don't require another trip.

## Decision Framework

| Condition                                         | Action          |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Per-unit landed cost < local alternative          | May be viable   |
| Per-unit landed cost > local alternative          | Need more volume|
| Margin is negative at any realistic volume        | Don't proceed   |
| Product unavailable locally at acceptable quality | May justify cost|

## India-Specific Considerations

- **IEC:** Import Export Code required for commercial imports
  (one-time registration, ~₹500, takes 1–2 weeks)
- **GST:** Registration allows claiming input tax credit on IGST
- **Banking:** Outward remittance for payment to suppliers may
  require LRS declaration if over $250,000/year
- **Forex:** Use authorized dealers or forex cards for CNY/USD
- **Compliance:** Keep all invoices, BOE (Bill of Entry), and
  shipping documents for GST and income tax records
