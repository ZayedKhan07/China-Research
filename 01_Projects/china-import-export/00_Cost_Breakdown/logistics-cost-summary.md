  sense at higher volumes; has minimum fees that hurt small shipments

## Summary

**Estimated logistics cost range (including duties on ~$1,000 goods):**
- **USD:** $175 – $1,785
- **AED:** AED 640 – AED 6,550
- **INR:** ₹14,500 – ₹1,48,000

**Realistic mid-range budget for first shipment: ~$835 / ₹69,000**
(assuming ~$1,000 in goods, ~23% combined duty/tax rate)

Key variables:
- Shipping method (courier vs. air vs. sea)
- Goods value (affects duties and taxes)
- Product category (affects duty rate and IGST rate)
- HS code classification (check ICEGATE before ordering)

Logistics costs can easily equal or exceed the product cost on small
first orders. This improves significantly at scale.

**India-specific notes:**
- IEC (Import Export Code) required for commercial imports
- GST registration helps claim input tax credit on IGST
- China → India shipping is competitive; many freight forwarders serve this route
- Nhava Sheva (Mumbai) and Chennai are major ports for China imports
