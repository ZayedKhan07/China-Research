# China Import-Export: First Market Visit

## Why this project exists

I'm a solo founder exploring whether importing products from China is
a viable business. Before committing money to inventory, freight, or
suppliers, I need to understand the full picture — not just product
prices, but every cost and step between my front door and a Chinese
market stall, and back again.

This project tracks the planning, execution, and learnings from a
first trip to China's wholesale markets (Yiwu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
or wherever the research points). The goal is to come back with
real numbers, real contacts, and a clear yes/no on whether to move
forward.

## What "door-to-door" means here

"Door-to-door" is the total cost and effort of the entire operation,
starting from the moment I leave home:

1. Getting to China (visa, flights, accommodation, daily spending)
2. Finding and vetting suppliers on the ground
3. Negotiating prices, ordering samples, agreeing on terms
4. Getting goods out of China (export docs, freight, insurance)
5. Getting goods into my country (customs, duties, VAT)
6. Receiving goods at my door (last-mile delivery, storage)

Most online guides only cover step 4. This project covers steps 1–6
so I can calculate the true landed cost per unit, including the
hidden costs of travel, time, and relationship-building.

## How the subfolders work

### `01_Pre-Travel/`
Everything that happens before boarding the plane. Visa applications,
flight comparisons, hotel options, daily budget estimates, and the
trip itinerary. Fill these out first — they set the travel budget
ceiling.

### `02_On-Ground_China/`
Plans and notes for when I'm physically in China. Which markets to
visit, which cities to cover, people I want to meet, whether I need
a translator or sourcing agent, and a running notes file for
anything that comes up on the ground.

### `03_Sourcing_and_Relationships/`
The core of the trip. Supplier contact details, meeting notes,
sample tracking, negotiation records, and payment terms. This is
where the business relationships live.

### `04_Logistics_and_Shipping/`
Everything about moving goods from a Chinese factory to my door.
Incoterms (FOB, CIF, DDP, etc.), freight quotes, customs
requirements, duty and VAT calculations, and last-mile delivery
options.

### `05_Risk_and_Learnings/`
What could go wrong, what did go wrong, and what to do differently
next time. This folder is meant to be filled honestly — it's the
most useful part of the project after the trip is over.

## Supporting folders (at repo root)

- **`00_Inbox/`** — Drop raw ideas, questions, and tasks here before
  sorting them into the right place.
- **`02_Research/`** — Vendor quotes, contact details, screenshots,
  and reference links. Supporting material that doesn't belong in the
  project subfolders.
- **`03_Templates/`** — Reusable templates for budgets, supplier
  meetings, cost breakdowns, and task tracking.
- **`04_Outputs/`** — Final deliverables: trip cost summary,
  door-to-door cost breakdown, and decision notes.
- **`99_Archive/`** — Completed or abandoned work, kept for reference.

## Who this is for

Me. A solo founder/operator figuring this out for the first time,
with no import-export background. The files are written for someone
who needs to make practical decisions — not for investors or
partners. If the numbers don't work, the project gets archived and
I move on.
