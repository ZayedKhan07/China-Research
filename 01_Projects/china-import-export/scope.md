# Scope — First China Market Visit

## What decisions this project supports

By the end of this project, I should be able to answer:

1. **Is importing from China worth pursuing?**
   Based on real numbers — not YouTube estimates or Alibaba listings.

2. **What does it actually cost, door-to-door?**
   Total landed cost per unit, including travel, sourcing, shipping,
   customs, duties, and last-mile. Not just the FOB price.

3. **Can I do this solo, or do I need an agent/partner?**
   Whether the language barrier, logistics complexity, and supplier
   management are manageable alone.

4. **What product categories are realistic for a first order?**
   Based on what I see on the ground, minimum order quantities,
   and shipping feasibility — not what looks good online.

5. **Should I go back for a second trip?**
   And if so, with what focus, what budget, and what contacts
   already in place.

## What is IN scope

This is a reconnaissance trip. The scope is deliberately narrow:

- Estimating and tracking all travel costs (visa, flights, hotels,
  daily expenses, local transport)
- Visiting 1–3 wholesale markets or trade cities
- Meeting suppliers face-to-face, without committing to orders
- Collecting real price quotes, MOQs, and lead times
- Understanding shipping options and getting freight quotes
- Researching customs, duties, and VAT for my destination country
- Requesting samples (small quantities, if affordable)
- Documenting everything: contacts, quotes, notes, photos
- Producing a door-to-door cost breakdown for at least one
  product category
- Making a go/no-go decision on whether to place a first order

## What is OUT of scope

These are not failures to address — they're intentionally excluded
from this phase:

- **Placing bulk orders.** This trip is for learning, not buying.
  No large purchase orders, no container shipments.
- **Setting up a company or legal entity in China.** Not needed yet.
- **Building an e-commerce store or sales channel.** Selling comes
  after sourcing is validated.
- **Branding, packaging design, or private labeling.** Premature
  until I know what product I'm importing.
- **Hiring staff, agents, or long-term contractors.** I may use a
  translator or day-hire agent on the ground, but no ongoing
  commitments.
- **Negotiating exclusive deals or contracts.** First visit is
  about understanding the landscape, not locking in terms.
- **Importing regulated or complex goods** (electronics requiring
  certification, food, pharmaceuticals). Stick to simple product
  categories for the first round.
- **Optimizing logistics or reducing costs.** First, understand the
  baseline. Optimization is a second-trip problem.

## What success looks like

The trip is successful if I come back with:

- A realistic, itemized door-to-door cost for at least one product
- Contact details for 3–5 suppliers I'd consider working with
- Samples in hand (or on the way) for at least one product
- A written record of what went well and what didn't
- Enough information to decide: proceed, pivot, or stop
- A clear sense of whether a second trip is justified and what
  it would focus on

The trip is not successful just because I visited markets and took
photos. The output has to be a decision I can act on.

## Decisions deferred to later phases

These are real decisions that matter, but answering them now would
be guessing. They get their own phase once this trip provides
actual data:

- **Which product to import first.** Depends on what I find on the
  ground, landed cost math, and market demand back home.
- **Which supplier to commit to.** Needs sample evaluation, a test
  order, and possibly a second visit.
- **Shipping method (air vs. sea vs. courier).** Depends on product
  size, weight, order volume, and urgency. Can't decide without
  real quotes on a real product.
- **Business structure and import licenses.** Only worth setting up
  once I've confirmed the economics work.
- **Sales channel and pricing strategy.** Requires knowing the
  landed cost first.
- **Scaling and repeat orders.** A second-trip concern at the
  earliest.
- **Partnering with someone.** First, find out what I can and
  can't handle solo.
