# China Import–Export Research & Door-to-Door Cost Breakdown

This repository is used to plan, document, and analyze the complete end-to-end process of importing and exporting products from China — starting from leaving home to visit China markets, building relationships on the ground, sourcing products, and delivering goods door-to-door to the destination country.

Here, “door-to-door” means the **entire business journey**, not just shipping.

## What “Door-to-Door” Means in This Repo

Door-to-door includes all stages:

- Travel planning to China
- Visa, flights, accommodation, and daily expenses

- Sampling, negotiation, and deal closure
- Export documentation and compliance
- Logistics and shipping (air / sea / courier)
- Customs clearance, duty, VAT, and last-mile delivery
- Final landed cost per product

The goal is to understand the **true cost, effort, and risk** of China import-export, not just freight pricing.
